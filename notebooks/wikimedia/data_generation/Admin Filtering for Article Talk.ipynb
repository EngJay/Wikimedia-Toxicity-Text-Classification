      "\"NEWLINENEWLINE{{divbox|grey|Cross posted from NPOV noticeboard|NEWLINE:This is a very well known book and writing a good article about it is easy so long as you keep it simple. Obviously include all the facts about the book's publication, and then cover the contents. Then you should have a section on \"\"reception\"\". It should include reviews of the book in the important media, from all viewpoints. Just state what the reviews said, e.g. \"\"X, writing in Y, said that the most important contribution of the book was that it .... However, he wished that it had ....\"\". It's very important to reflect the exact tone of each review, i.e. don't pick out an isolated favourable comment from a review that was mainly critical. Give most space to the reviews in the print and broadcast media, less to those in web-only media unless they are highly respected. [[User:Itsmejudith|Itsmejudith]] ([[User talk:Itsmejudith|talk]]) 08:21, 22 June 2008 (UTC)NEWLINENEWLINE::Excellent advice.  I think the major concern is that the book itself is a whistleblower's account of what happened in a political environment, and as such we have plenty of commentary from subjects that may be notable, but are definitely completely unconnected to the events, the book, or the author.  It's easy for politicians to make statements (both positive and negative) with political motivations rather than having any actual connection.  Since that is the case, I strongly believe that we should limit opinions injected into the article to people who are actually connected to the subject.  You bring up some excellent points, and I'm going to cross post this conversation there.  I would request additional comments be directed to the [[Talk:What Happened#Request for Comment: Undue Weight|open RFC]]. /[[USER:Blaxthos|Blaxthos]] <small>( [[User Talk:Blaxthos|t]] / [[Special:Contributions/Blaxthos|c]] )</small> 20:23, 22 June 2008 (UTC)NEWLINE}}\"\n",

So, when you say \"\"which ''now'' included the Abhinav Bharat Society, etc.\"\", the reader is left wondering, \"\"What was it before this?\"\" You need either to use that phrase earlier in the article (and say what it was, or included) or explain here what it included ''before'' additional groups were included. Otherwise, you need to remove the word \"\"now\"\".NEWLINENEWLINE8) The next sentence in that section is:NEWLINENEWLINE*Unlike the latter, it became wholly self-reliant in finances, organisation, as well as ideological mores.NEWLINENEWLINE(a) It's not clear to what the pronoun \"\"it\"\" refers.

Does that mean that the other two did not return to India? If so, then how could they have facilitated the transport of weapons to India? As you can see, this sentence needs some attention.NEWLINENEWLINE11) The last paragraph in [[India House#Transformation]] is:NEWLINENEWLINE*By 1908, the India House group had overtaken the London Indian Society (LIS), established in 1865 by Dadabhoi Naoroji, until then the largest association of Indians in London. Subsequently, India House took over the control of LIS when, at the annual general meeting that year, members of India House packed the gathering and ousted the old guard of the society.NEWLINENEWLINEAlthough the two sentences are probably about two different things, the use of \"\"had overtaken\"\" in the first sentence and \"\"took over\"\" in the second might make the reader think that the two sentences are saying something similar but with different words. Also, \"\"had overtaken\"\" is not completely clear. Does it mean \"\"had overtaken in numbers of members\"\", or membership, or does it mean \"\"took control of\"\"? If it means the first one, then I would add some words to clarify it.NEWLINENEWLINE12) The first sentence of the second paragraph in [[India House#Culmination]] is:NEWLINENEWLINE*In the aftermath of the assassination, India House was rapidly shut down.

You need either to delete \"\"gradually\"\" or give a brief explanation as to why it was gradual and not immediate.NEWLINENEWLINE13) In the section [[India House#Department of Criminal Intelligence]], I see \"\"V.V.S.
